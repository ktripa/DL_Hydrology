\section{Data Structures in Python}

\subsection{Lists and Tuples}
Python provides several compound data types, useful for grouping together other values. The most versatile of these are lists and tuples, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square brackets for lists, or parentheses for tuples.

\subsubsection{Creating Lists and Tuples}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Creating a list
rainfall = [20.5, 30.2, 25.4, 12.2]

# Creating a tuple
months = ('January', 'February', 'March', 'April')
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Accessing Elements, Slicing, and List Comprehensions}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Accessing elements
print(rainfall[1])  # Output: 30.2

# Slicing
print(months[0:2])  # Output: ('January', 'February')

# List comprehension
squared = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squared)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Dictionaries}
Dictionaries are another fundamental data structure in Python. They store mappings of unique keys to values and are incredibly efficient for retrieving data.

\subsubsection{Creating and Manipulating Dictionaries}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Creating a dictionary
river_flow = {'Amazon': 209000, 'Nile': 2830, 'Yangtze': 31900}

# Adding a new key-value pair
river_flow['Mississippi'] = 16200
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Importance of Dictionaries in Data Handling}
Dictionaries allow for rapid data retrieval via keys and are essential for data processing tasks where relationships between elements must be efficiently established and accessed.

\subsection{Sets and Frozensets}
Sets are collections of distinct (unique) items that are useful when you want to ensure no duplicates are present.

\subsubsection{Characteristics of Sets and Their Utility}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Creating a set
unique_rivers = set(['Amazon', 'Nile', 'Yangtze', 'Nile'])
print(unique_rivers)  # Output: {'Yangtze', 'Amazon', 'Nile'}

# Creating a frozenset
immutable_rivers = frozenset(['Amazon', 'Nile'])
\end{lstlisting}

Sets are particularly useful in data processing for operations like union, intersection, and difference, which can help in filtering and comparing datasets.

\section{Data Structures in Python}

Data structures are fundamental ways of organizing data to ensure efficient access and modification. Python simplifies learning these fundamentals compared to other programming languages, making it an ideal choice for hydrologists and environmental scientists.

\subsection{Lists}
Python lists are versatile and can be compared to arrays in other programming languages but with the added benefit of being able to store different types of data. Lists in Python are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink, and they are implemented similarly to vectors in C++ or ArrayLists in Java.

\subsubsection{Basic List Operations}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Creating a List with hydrological data points
rainfall_mm = [20, 30, 45, 50]
print("Monthly Rainfall in mm: ")
print(rainfall_mm)

# Creating a Multi-Dimensional List for different regions
region_rainfall = [['North', 20], ['South', 30]]
print("\nRegion-Wise Rainfall:")
print(region_rainfall) 

# Accessing elements using positive and negative indexing
print("\nAccessing the first and last element:")
print(rainfall_mm[0], rainfall_mm[-1])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{List Comprehension}
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications include creating new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Using list comprehension to square numbers
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(6)]
print("\nSquared numbers from 0 to 5:")
print(squared_numbers)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Dictionaries}
Dictionaries in Python are hash tables that store data in a key-value pair. They provide very fast O(1) time complexity for looking up data and are particularly useful in scenarios where the dataset is large and search speed is critical.

\subsubsection{Using Dictionaries in Hydrology}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Creating a dictionary to store river discharge rates
discharge = {'Amazon': 209000, 'Nile': 2830, 'Yangtze': 31900}
print("River discharge rates (cubic meters per second):")
print(discharge)

# Accessing data by river name
print("\nDischarge of the Nile:")
print(discharge['Nile'])

# Using get() to safely access elements
print("\nDischarge of the Ganges:")
print(discharge.get('Ganges', 'No data available'))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Dictionary Comprehension}
Dictionary comprehensions offer a method to succinctly create dictionaries from a set of values.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Creating a dictionary to map river names to their lengths
river_length = {river: length for river, length in [('Amazon', 6400), ('Nile', 6650)]}
print("\nRiver lengths in kilometers:")
print(river_length)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Tuples}
Tuples are immutable sequences in Python, used to store collections of heterogeneous data. Tuples are particularly useful when you need a fixed set of elements that should not change throughout the program.

\subsubsection{Creating and Using Tuples}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Defining a tuple for geographic coordinates
coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)
print("Coordinates of New York City:")
print(coordinates)

# Single element tuple, notice the comma
single_tuple = ('single',)
\end{lstlisting}

Tuples are not just immutable lists; they can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets, which is not possible with lists due to their mutability. This characteristic makes tuples incredibly useful in high-performance computing scenarios where data integrity and speed are paramount.

These sections provide a robust introduction to Python data structures with practical examples that demonstrate their application in environmental science and hydrology. This approach not only helps in understanding Python's capabilities but also illustrates its practical benefits in scientific computing.
